# Welcome, my name is Rafael

## Here are some projects which I have completed while pursuing my Master's degree in Statistics and Data Science at the University of Houston.
## They showcase my ability to code, visualize, and write reports summarizing the results. 


# [Project 1: Classifying Subject Body Positions Based on Limb Movements](https://github.com/rafasuarez24/position_classification/blob/main/Final_Suarez_Raphael.pdf)
* Objective of the porject was to classify body positions of subjects with monitors on hands, wrists, and head.
* Velocity and position of limbs was measured.
* Used PCA analysis, K-means clustering, random forests, and a linear SVM model in R.
* Report and code can be viewed by clicking the link.

# [Project 2: Classifying Fonts Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/rafasuarez24/fonts_classification/blob/main/6373%20HW3%20Report.pdf)
* Selected 5 different fonts to classify.
* Each case was reshaped in order to obtain 20x20 images.
* 2 convolutional layers and 2 max pooling layers before flattening images into a large vector of features.
* Secondary objective was to experiment with hidden layer size to find optimal model.
* Click on link to see report + results.

# [Project 3: Movies Dataset Visualization](https://github.com/rafasuarez24/movies_project/blob/main/movie_project_summary.pdf)
* Explored a Kaggle dataset with over 100k movies.
* Used Tableau to create interactive and informative visualizations regarding actors, genres, and Rotten Tomatoes rating.
* Used highlights, filters, and other techniques to create communicating dashboards.
* Click the link to see screenshots and summaries of the project.
