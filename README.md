# [Project 1: Movies Dataset Visualization](https://github.com/rafasuarez24/movies_project/blob/main/movie_project_summary.pdf)
* Explored a Kaggle dataset with over 100k movies.
* Used Tableau to create interactive and informative visualizations regarding actors, genres, and Rotten Tomatoes rating.
* Used highlights, filters, and other techniques to create communicating dashboards.

# [Project 2: Classifying Subject Body Positions Based on Limb Movements](https://github.com/rafasuarez24/position_classification/blob/main/Final_Suarez_Raphael.pdf)
* Objective of the porject was to classify body positions of subjects with monitors on hands, wrists, and head.
* Velocity and position of limbs was measured.
* Used PCA analysis, K-means clustering, random forests, and a linear SVM model in R.
* Report and code can be viewed by clicking the link.

# Project 3: Classifying Fonts Using COnvolutional Neural Networks
* Selected 5 different fonts to classify.
* Each case was reshaped in order to obtain 20x20 images.
* 2 convolutional layers and 2 max pooling layers before flattening images into a large vector of features.
* Secondary objective was to experiment with hidden layer size to find optimal model.
